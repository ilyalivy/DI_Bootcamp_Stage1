        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln" target="_blank">Abraham Lincoln</a> was born on February 12, 1809, in a log cabin in Hardin County, Kentucky. His family later moved to Indiana and then to Illinois, where Lincoln would spend most of his adult life.

            As a young man, Lincoln worked various jobs and largely self-educated himself by reading and studying law. He began practicing law in 1836 and became involved in politics, serving in the Illinois state legislature and later in the U.S. House of Representatives.
            
            In 1860, Lincoln ran for president as the candidate of the newly formed Republican Party. He won the election and took office in March 1861, just as the country was on the brink of Civil War.
            <br>
            During his presidency, Lincoln led the Union through the Civil War, navigating political and military challenges and working to keep the country together. He also issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared that all slaves in Confederate territory would be free.
            
            Lincoln was reelected in 1864, but his second term was cut short when he was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth on April 14, 1865, just days after the Confederate surrender at Appomattox Court House.
            
            Lincoln is widely regarded as one of America's greatest leaders, known for his humility, honesty, and commitment to preserving the Union and ending slavery. His legacy continues to inspire people around the world to this day.</p>
